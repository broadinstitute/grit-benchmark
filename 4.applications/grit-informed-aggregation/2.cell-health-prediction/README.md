We used grit-informed well-level profiles to build concensus profiles for use in the Cell Health prediction pipeline.

We use normalized, single-cell profiles from the Cell Health experiment and single-cell grit scores (calculated with respect to Chr2 cutting controls and using normalized, feature selected profiles).

We used the same feature columns as the original Cell Health project did, and ran the pipeline using both standard median aggregated well-level profiles *and* well-level profiles weighted by each single cell's grit score.
